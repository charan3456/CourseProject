This project requires Xcode to run.

Use Case
1. Interior Design: Primarily used by interior designers and homeowners to visualize different tile patterns on floors or walls in real-time.
2. Renovation Projects: Ideal for those planning to renovate empty rooms, as it allows for experimenting with various tile designs before purchase or installation.
3. Real Estate and Property Development: Useful for property developers or real estate agents to present potential design options to clients in empty properties.

Functionalities
1. Surface Scanning: Utilizes a camera or a scanning device to capture the dimensions and layout of a flat surface within an empty room.
2. Tile Pattern Selection: Offers a library of tile patterns which users can browse through and select for visualization.
3. Augmented Reality (AR) Integration: Uses AR technology for more immersive and accurate visualization.

Limitations
1. Room Requirement: Only functional in empty rooms, limiting its use in spaces with furniture or other obstructions.
2. Surface Compatibility: May not accurately scan and visualize on irregularly shaped or non-flat surfaces.
3. Software Limitations: The variety of tile patterns and customization features are limited to the software's database.
4. Accuracy of Visualization: The final look may differ from the visualization due to factors like lighting, tile batch differences, and installation quality.
